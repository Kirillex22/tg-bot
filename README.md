# tgBotRecipe
This thing can send you some recipes. Some of them could be a little strange, but it depends only on API that you're using.
Integrates into telegram using API (you need API key).

Extra abilities:
- conversion to standard quantities (kg and so on)
- answering random messages
- sending pictures by request
- instantaneous recipe change, if you want something another
